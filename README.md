# PHP Learning Management System (LMS)

A feature-rich Learning Management System built with **PHP**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**, designed to facilitate seamless interaction between admins, teachers, students, and academic officers. This project was my introduction to web development, and while it functions effectively, some design improvements (e.g., using the Singleton pattern for database connections) can be incorporated in the future.

## 🏗️ **Project Limitations**
